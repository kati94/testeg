  <center><h2>We invite you to explore job and career opportunities in the New York State Education Department.  The Department is responsible for educational services from pre-kindergarten through graduate school and oversees licensed professions, certified educators, as well as cultural institutions including libraries, archives and museums, and provides services to individuals with disabilities.  This unparalleled combination of responsibilities creates special employment opportunities.</h2></center>
  <center><h2>The best way to get a job anywhere is through networking, so let's talk about how to network effectively.


Figure out the exact job title you're looking for. This is incredibly important because it lets you target your search and it makes it much easier for people to refer you. For example, if someone approaches me, impresses me, and tells me they're looking for a job as a Senior Risk Analyst, I know exactly who I can refer them to. If they just tell me they're looking for a job, I don't know who I can tell.
Find people who either have or used to have that job and ask them what the job is like. One method is to approach people on LinkedIn who have some sort of relationship to you, such as having graduated from the same college. But even if you just cold email people asking for advice, a lot of them are happy to respond. Note that you shouldn't be specifically asking for help with finding a job at this point-just focus on learning what the role is like. If they offer to forward your resume, accept-but that's not the goal here.
Now that you understand the role, build your cover letter/resume/narrative. If you don't like the role, go back to step 1. If you do, now you want to build your story for exactly why you're the perfect candidate for the position. Now is the time to continue meeting people and specifically mentioning that you're looking for job X. You can also go back and approach the people you met before. Roughly speaking, about 10-30% of these informal interviews should lead to formal interviews, which should lead to you getting a job.
Once you've got the job, keep networking. This is vital-even if you don't plan to change jobs in the near future, talking to other professionals gives you a broad sense of context that will help you advance your career at a very quick rate, makes it easy to get good advice when you need it, helps you hire people, and so on.</h2></center>
